# Water Quality EDA & Insight Report

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a water-quality dataset to investigate chemical and biological indicators that determine whether water samples are safe or unsafe.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This repository performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) of water quality measurements (heavy metals, ions, bacteria/virus indicators, etc.) and provides visualizations and insights about factors associated with `is_safe` (0 = Unsafe, 1 = Safe). The work focuses on data understanding, cleaning, visualization, outlier detection, and summary insights — no machine learning models are built.

## ✅ Key Features

- Data loading & structure inspection
- Missing value checks and simple imputation (median)
- Duplicate removal
- Univariate analysis (histograms, KDE, boxplots)
- Bivariate analysis vs `is_safe` (boxplots, group-wise means)
- Correlation analysis and heatmap
- Outlier detection using IQR and Z-score
- Save cleaned dataset for downstream use
- Google Colab friendly (upload & download support)
